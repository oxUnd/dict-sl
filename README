Stardict Client
===============

A simple, suckless Stardict dictionary lookup client written in pure C.

Features:
- Reads Stardict .ifo, .idx, and .dict files
- Performs binary search for fast word lookup
- Outputs definition to stdout
- Minimal dependencies (only standard C libraries)

Usage:
    ./stardict <dict_dir> <dict_name> <word>

Example:
    ./stardict /usr/share/stardict/dic stardict-english-chinese hello

Compilation:
    gcc -o stardict main.c

Notes:
- Assumes 32-bit offsets in .idx file
- Does not handle compressed .idx.gz or .dict.dz files
- Ignores sametypesequence for simplicity
- Definitions are assumed to be plain text
